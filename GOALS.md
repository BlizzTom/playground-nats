# Goals of this playground

This is just a list of things I want to get out of playing around with NATS.

* [x] **Hub and Spoke Deployment** understand the configurations for leaf nodes
* [x] **NKey based Security** understand how to manage/configure nkeys
* [x] **Jetstream** Identical streams per cluster, intentional that all clusters get a copy of the message.
* [x] **Multi Tenancy** Account level authorizations
* [x] **ACL** Understand how the ACL system works (can sub to a few topics, can publish a few topics, can respond to a few requests)
* [x] **Account Management** understand how nsc cli does this
* [x] **Consumer Management** understand how nats cli does this
* [ ] **MQTT** setup and experiment with MQTT with an off the shelf MQTT pub/sub tool
